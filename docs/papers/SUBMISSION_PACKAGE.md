### 📧 Cover Letter Template

Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Computational Verification of the Complete N-Square Identity Chain: From Brahmagupta (628 AD) to Pfister (1965)" for consideration in the Journal of Mathematical Software.

This paper presents the first complete computational implementation of the historical n-square identity chain spanning 1,400 years of mathematical development. Our work provides:

1. **Complete Implementation**: Unified framework covering 2D (Brahmagupta), 4D (Euler), 8D (Degen), and 16D (Pfister) identities
2. **Rigorous Verification**: 33 passing test cases demonstrating exact norm preservation
3. **Novel Contribution**: First TypeScript implementation of the complete identity chain
4. **Open Source**: Fully available code for community verification

The implementation confirms the mathematical validity of each identity through computational verification, providing concrete evidence for theoretical results that span over a millennium. This work bridges historical mathematics with modern computational methods and offers a valuable resource for both researchers and educators.

We believe this paper is an excellent fit for the Journal of Mathematical Software as it presents novel, verified software that advances mathematical computation and education.

The manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript for submission.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
