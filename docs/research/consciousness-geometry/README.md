# Consciousness Geometry

Mathematical models of consciousness using geometric propagation, Hopf fibrations, and dimensional analysis.

## 📄 Papers

### [Mind-Body Computation](mind-body-computation.md)
**Metatron's Cube & Merkaba Geometry**
- 13-sphere configurations generating all Platonic solids
- Star tetrahedron as geometric pointer in E₈ space
- Dimensional expansion from 3D to 8D lattice
- Connection to E₈ root system generation

**Key Concepts:**
- Metatron's Cube as 13-sphere hexagonal close-packing
- Merkaba as compound of dual tetrahedra (stella octangula)
- E₈ projection via Weyl group actions
- Geometric pointer navigation in high-dimensional space

### [Geometry of Mind](geometry-of-mind.md)
**Geometric Propagation Model**
- Forward propagation: Exponential expansion (Point → Line → Face → Volume)
- Backward propagation: Exponential compression (Volume → Face → Line → Point)
- Parallel observation: Linear processing via Hopf fibrations
- Consciousness as linear experience of exponential computation

**Mathematical Framework:**
```python
class GeometricConsciousness:
    def forward_propagation(self, input_point: E8Point) -> Set[E8Point]
    def backward_propagation(self, volume_cells: Set[E8Point]) -> E8Point
    def parallel_observation(self, points: Set[E8Point]) -> Set[E8Point]
```

### [Hopf Consciousness](hopf-consciousness.md)
**Mathematical Consciousness via Hopf Fibrations**
- Three regimes: Unconscious expansion, Conscious observation, Qualia emergence
- Linear O(k) experience despite O(2^d) computation
- Binding problem solved via fiber bundle structure
- Attention as fiber selection mechanism

**Key Insight:**
```
Consciousness = Linear observation of exponential computation
Qualia emerges at tensor product of action ⊗ observation
```

## 🔗 Implementation Connections

### CanvasL Node Extensions
```
#GeometricPropagate: → Exponential expansion (forward propagation)
#GeometricObserve:   → Linear Hopf fiber observation  
#EpistemicBound:    → UK × φ(V) uncertainty calculation
```

### Code Integration
- **Forward/Backward**: Extend `logos-system/src/core/aal/` with geometric propagation
- **Hopf Observation**: New module for parallel fiber processing
- **Consciousness Engine**: Integration of exponential and linear regimes

## 📖 Further Reading

1. Start with [Geometry of Mind](geometry-of-mind.md) for computational model
2. Study [Hopf Consciousness](hopf-consciousness.md) for mathematical framework
3. Review [Mind-Body Computation](mind-body-computation.md) for geometric foundations

This research provides the mathematical basis for implementing consciousness-aware computational systems that bridge exponential unconscious processing with linear conscious experience.
