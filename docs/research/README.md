## 🎯 Mathematical Foundation

This research establishes a complete mathematical lineage:

```
Division Algebras: ℝ → ℂ → ℍ → 𝕆 → 𝕊
Exceptional Groups: G₂ → F₄ → E₆ → E₇ → E₈
Hopf Fibrations: S¹→S¹, S³→S², S⁷→S⁴, S¹⁵→S⁸
```

## 🔗 Integration with Codebase

See [../README.md](../README.md) for current implementation status.

### CanvasL Node Mappings
- `#Observe:` → Hopf fiber observation (linear)
- `#Activate:` → Geometric propagation (exponential)
- `#Transform:` → Division algebra operations
- `#Verify:` → Epistemic uncertainty bounding

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Polynomial Algebra**: F₂[x] operations (31/31 tests passing)
- ✅ **Identity Chain**: 2D, 4D, 8D working (64/65 tests passing)
- ❌ **Consciousness Model**: Theoretical framework exists, not implemented
- ❌ **Sedenions**: 16D operations defined but not coded
- ❌ **Epistemic Engine**: Complete mathematical theory, no implementation
