### [Epistemic Observability Engine](epistemic-observability-engine.md)
**UK × φ(V) Uncertainty Bounding**

Revolutionary approach to achieving strictly bounded epistemic uncertainty in arbitrarily large distributed systems using purely classical, deterministic, and geometrically native operations.

**Core Breakthrough: Vision-Epistemic Isomorphism**
```
Observable State = UK × φ(V)
```
where:
- **UK** ∈ ℝ⁺ is unknown-known component
- **V** is vertex count of observed system  
- **φ** is Euler's totient function

**Mathematical Guarantee:**
```
lim sup |V|→∞  O(ε, V) / log log |V| < ∞
```

### Key Components

#### Exceptional Lie Group Cascade
```
G₂ → F₄ → E₆ → E₇ → E₈
14D   52D   78D   133D   248D
```

#### Dimensional Reduction Pipeline
```
E₈ (248D) → E₇ (133D) → F₄ (52D) → ℝ⁴ (24-cell)
```

#### Core Mechanisms
1. **Canonicalization** via Weyl group of E₈
2. **Parameterization** with UK × φ(V) bound
3. **Q* Optimization** on F₄ manifold
4. **Geometric RBAC** via F₄/E₇ projective geometry
5. **Non-collapsing Observation** via G₂ automorphisms

```

### Bounding Theorem
For any epistemic state ε over system with |V| entities:
```
O(ε, V) = UK(V) × φ(V)
```

### Algebraic Identity
