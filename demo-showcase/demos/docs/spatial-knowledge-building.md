# Spatial Knowledge Building

Draw a CanvasL diagram (e.g., a reasoning tree), compiles to code, and shows topological invariance.

## Demo Information

- **Category:** visual
- **Audience:** general
- **Functions:** visual-compilation
- **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of visual diagrams
- Interest in spatial reasoning
- No programming experience required

## Learning Objectives

- Create spatial reasoning diagrams in CanvasL
- Understand topological invariance
- Compile visual diagrams to executable code
- Explore spatial knowledge representation

## Step-by-Step Guide


### Step 1: Create Central Question

Start with the main question or concept you want to explore.




### Step 2: Add Supporting Concepts

Add related concepts that contribute to answering the question.




### Step 3: Establish Relationships

Draw connections between concepts to show their relationships.




### Step 4: Synthesize Conclusion

Create a conclusion node that integrates all the contributing factors.




### Step 5: Compile and Verify

Compile the diagram and verify topological invariance is maintained.

```

## Verification Results

Spatial arrangements are encoded as polynomial coefficients. Graph topology is preserved through algebraic divisibility relationships, ensuring topological invariance during compilation.

## Running the Demo

```bash
# Install MIND-GIT
npm install -g mind-git

# Compile the canvas
mind-git compile spatial-knowledge-building.canvas

# Run the generated code
node spatial-knowledge-building.js
```

## Expected Output

Executable JavaScript code that maintains the reasoning structure and produces the same logical conclusions as the visual diagram.
