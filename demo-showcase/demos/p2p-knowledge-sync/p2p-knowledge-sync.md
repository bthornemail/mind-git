# P2P Knowledge Sync

Simulates a multi-peer mesh, syncs nodes in real-time via WebRTC, and resolves a mock contradiction.

## Demo Information

- **Category:** distributed
- **Audience:** enterprises
- **Functions:** federation-sync
- **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of P2P networking concepts
- Familiarity with WebRTC
- Knowledge of distributed systems

## Learning Objectives

- Set up P2P mesh network with WebRTC
- Synchronize semantic graphs across peers
- Resolve contradictions through consensus voting
- Implement federated knowledge management

## Step-by-Step Guide


### Step 1: Initialize P2P Network

Set up WebRTC connections between peers for real-time synchronization.




### Step 2: Share Knowledge Nodes

Distribute semantic nodes across the peer network with automatic conflict detection.




### Step 3: Detect Contradictions

Automatically identify when peers have conflicting information about the same concept.




### Step 4: Consensus Resolution

Use voting-based consensus to resolve contradictions and maintain knowledge consistency.




### Step 5: Verify Synchronization

Ensure all peers have consistent knowledge graphs after resolution.

    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification Results

P2P synchronization uses polynomial hashing for efficient knowledge comparison. Consensus voting is weighted by mathematical confidence scores derived from norm preservation properties.

## Running the Demo
