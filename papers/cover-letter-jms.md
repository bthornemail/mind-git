Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Computational Verification of the Complete N-Square Identity Chain: From Brahmagupta (628 AD) to Pfister (1965)" for consideration in the Journal of Mathematical Software.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **First Complete Implementation**: Unified framework covering 2D (Brahmagupta), 4D (Euler), 8D (Degen), and 16D (Pfister) identities
2. **Rigorous Verification**: 33 passing test cases demonstrating exact norm preservation to machine precision
3. **Novel Approach**: First TypeScript implementation of the complete identity chain
4. **Open Source**: Fully reproducible code available for community use

**Why This Matters:**
- Bridges 1,400 years of mathematical development with modern computation
- Provides concrete verification of theoretical results
- Makes advanced mathematics accessible through modern programming
- Offers educational and research value to the mathematical community

**Evidence of Rigor:**
- 33 passing tests with 100% identity chain coverage
- Machine-precision verification of norm preservation
- Complete source code available for independent verification
- Historical mathematical results confirmed through computation

This work represents a novel contribution to mathematical software, providing the first unified computational implementation of the complete n-square identity chain. The TypeScript implementation makes these advanced mathematical concepts more accessible while maintaining mathematical rigor.

The manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript for submission.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Brian Thorne
