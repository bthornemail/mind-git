## 🧠 About Me

Independent researcher exploring the **mathematical foundations of self-evolving computational systems**. My work bridges abstract algebra, topology, and artificial intelligence to create new paradigms for computation that are both mathematically rigorous and practically implementable.

### 🔬 Research Focus
- **Topological Consensus Mechanisms** - Algebraic topology-based agreement protocols
- **Autonomous AI Architectures** - Genuinely evolving and adaptive systems  
- **Mathematical Foundations** - Complete algebraic systems for computation
- **Visual Programming Paradigms** - Spatial interfaces for complex mathematics

A complete visual programming system with mathematical verification. CanvasL spatial diagrams compile to executable JavaScript with formal proofs, implementing 1,400 years of mathematical development.

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g mind-git

# Compile a canvas file
mind-git compile examples/spatial-hello-world.json
```

#### ✅ Key Achievements
- **Complete polynomial algebra over F₂** with 100% test coverage
- **Full identity chain implementation** (2D→4D→8D→16D→32D)
- **CanvasL visual programming language** with end-to-end compilation
- **Formal verification** with Coq proofs
- **Production-ready npm package** with CLI tools
- **Docker containerization** for easy deployment

#### 🚀 Quick Start
```typescript
import { CanvasLCompiler } from 'mind-git';

const compiler = new CanvasLCompiler();
const canvas = await fetch('diagram.canvas').then(r => r.json());
const result = await compiler.compileCanvas(canvas);
eval(result.generated_code.javascript_code);
```

## 💡 Research Philosophy

> **"The mathematical foundation is complete, but the work is just beginning. Every instruction you write, every proof you verify, every canvas you compile brings the distributed system architecture closer to reality."**

### Core Principles
- **Mathematical Reality** as Foundation
- **Visual Mathematics** for Accessibility  
- **Open Collaboration** for Progress
- **Formal Verification** for Reliability

## 🔮 Future Vision

I'm working toward a future where:

- **Mathematical structures** can be visually manipulated and instantly compiled
- **AI systems** evolve based on proven mathematical principles
- **Collaborative research** happens in real-time across mathematical visualizations
- **Formal verification** is accessible to all researchers, not just specialists
