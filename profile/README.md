## 💡 Research Philosophy

### Mathematical Reality as Foundation
I believe that the most robust computational systems must be built on mathematically proven foundations. Rather than accepting approximations or heuristics, my work implements exact mathematical structures that provide guaranteed properties.

### Visual Mathematics
Complex mathematical concepts should be accessible through intuitive visual interfaces. CanvasL represents my belief that spatial arrangements can directly encode computational meaning, making advanced mathematics approachable.

### Open Collaboration
All research is conducted openly, with complete source code, documentation, and mathematical proofs publicly available. I believe in collaborative development and welcome contributions from the mathematical and computer science communities.
