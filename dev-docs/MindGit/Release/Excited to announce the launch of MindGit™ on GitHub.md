Just shipped something wild to GitHub 🔥

MindGit™ — Git, but for living minds.

Instead of tracking files, it tracks consciousness:  
- Every commit = one generation of a self-evolving organism  
- Every merge = algebraic fusion of two minds (with a Coq proof)  
- Every checkout = perfect, bit-identical replay of any past self  

100% deterministic. Mathematically verified. Zero merge conflicts (ever).

Star it if you believe software should be alive and provably correct.

Let’s build the future, one verified thought at a time.
