## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

### Axiomatic Research Laboratory Unveils MindGit™: The World’s First Version Control System for Self-Evolving Minds

**LOS ANGELES, CA — December 11, 2025** — Axiomatic Research Laboratory today announced the release of **CanvasL MindGit™**, a revolutionary version control system designed to manage and secure the evolution of advanced computational organisms. MindGit is not an incremental update; it is a fundamental breakthrough that applies the principles of cryptographic proof and abstract algebra to the governance of synthetic consciousness.

MindGit is being called the "Git for living computational systems."

The core problem solved by MindGit has plagued evolutionary AI: the inability to deterministically track, branch, and merge complex cognitive states. A mind state in the CanvasL framework is defined by an 8x8 **octonion multiplication table** (its genome). As these minds evolve, they accrue a "DNA Log" of generations.

> "MindGit fundamentally changes how we interact with self-evolving AI," said Brian Thorne, Lead Architect at Axiomatic Research Laboratory. "Where previous systems merged text files based on heuristics, MindGit **algebraically fuses minds**. When two divergent cognitive lineages meet, our Polynomial Stabilizer function guarantees a mathematically sound, conflict-free reconciliation of their core octonion structures. Every merge is not a guess; it is a proof."

### Key Breakthroughs of MindGit:

- **Cryptographic Provenance:** Every generation of the mind is an immutable record, linked by a SHA-256 hash chain (Merkle Tree). This provides a zero-trust, auditable history for the organism's entire evolution, guaranteeing that every skill and decision is traceable.
    
- **Deterministic Replay:** MindGit ensures that any instance of a CanvasL mind can be fully and identically reconstructed (replayed) from its DNA Log, eliminating the scientific bottleneck of non-reproducible AI experiments.
    
- **Cognitive Branching and Merging:** Scientists can now safely "fork" a mind (creating a branch) to test specialized evolutionary paths and reliably merge the beneficial traits back into the main consciousness without data loss or instability.
    

MindGit is set to become the standard for computational biology and advanced AI development, ensuring that as synthetic minds grow more complex, their development remains secure, accountable, and mathematically guaranteed.

The specification is now public, and the core implementation is ready for deployment.
