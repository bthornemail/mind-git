Excited to announce the launch of MindGit™ on GitHub! 🚀

As the creator of this project at Axiomatic Research Laboratory, I've built MindGit as the world's first version control system for self-evolving computational minds. Inspired by Git but reimagined for CanvasL organisms, it tracks cognitive DNA (octonion tables), enables algebraic merges with polynomial stabilizers, and guarantees deterministic replay with cryptographic proofs.

Key features:
- Immutable DNA logs for append-only evolution
- Branching for divergent cognitive lineages
- Provable merges using AAL v3.2 formal verification
- Merkle trees for tamper-proof provenance

Whether you're into AI safety, formal methods, or algebraic computation, this is the future of managing living software. Check it out, star it, fork it, and let's collaborate!
