Excited to announce mind-git v1.1.0 is now available on npm!

This visual programming system transforms spatial diagrams into mathematically verified executable code, implementing a 1,400-year chain of mathematical proofs from Brahmagupta (628 AD) to Adams (1960).

Key features:
✅ Polynomial algebra over F₂
✅ Formal verification with Coq
✅ Visual canvas compilation
✅ CLI tool with multiple binaries

Install: npm install -g mind-git

https://www.npmjs.com/package/mind-git
```

[Release] mind-git v1.1.0 - Visual programming with mathematical verification

I've released mind-git on npm - a visual programming system where spatial node arrangements compile to verified executable code through polynomial algebra over F₂.

Key innovation: Unlike traditional visual programming tools that use diagrams as metaphors, mind-git's spatial arrangements ARE the mathematical structure.

- 1,400-year mathematical foundation (Brahmagupta → Adams)
- Formal verification via Coq proofs
- Compiles canvas files to JavaScript
- CLI tool with multiple utilities

Installation: npm install -g mind-git

GitHub: https://github.com/bthornemail/mind-git
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mind-git
