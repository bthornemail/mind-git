```
🚀 mind-git v1.1.0 is live on npm!

Transform spatial diagrams into verified executable code in 1ms.

Watch it in action: [asciinema link]

Install: npm install -g mind-git

```
**Attach**: Terminal recording link or GIF

### Twitter/X Post 2: Mathematical Foundation
```
Did you know mind-git implements 1,400 years of mathematics?

628 AD (Brahmagupta) → 1748 (Euler) → 1928 (Degen) → 1960 (Adams) → 2025 (mind-git)

The math doesn't lie. Now you can prove it.

npm install -g mind-git
```

### LinkedIn Post: Professional Launch
```
🎉 Excited to announce mind-git v1.1.0 - now available on npm!

A visual programming system where spatial node arrangements compile to mathematically verified executable code.

Key innovations:
✅ Polynomial algebra over F₂ for lossless compression
✅ 1,400-year mathematical foundation (Brahmagupta → Adams)
✅ Formal verification with Coq proofs
✅ Multi-language output (JS, TS, Racket, WASM)
✅ CLI tool: npm install -g mind-git

Unlike traditional visual programming tools that use diagrams as metaphors for code, mind-git's spatial arrangements ARE the mathematical structure. Node positions directly encode polynomial coefficients.

The complete identity chain from complex numbers (628 AD) to Adams' dimensional limit theorem (1960) ensures correctness.

Perfect for:
• Mathematicians exploring computational algebra
• Compiler engineers studying spatial compilation
• Visual programmers wanting formal verification
• Researchers investigating novel programming paradigms

Try it today:
npm install -g mind-git

### Reddit r/programming Post
```
Title: [Release] mind-git v1.1.0 - Visual programming with 1,400 years of mathematical proof

I've released mind-git on npm - a visual programming system where spatial arrangements of nodes compile to verified executable code through polynomial algebra over F₂.

The innovation: Unlike traditional visual programming where diagrams are metaphors, spatial positions directly map to polynomial degrees. An observer at (0,0) serves as the identity element (P₀ = 1), and node distance determines polynomial degree.

Mathematical foundation:
- 628 AD: Brahmagupta (2D complex numbers)
- 1748: Euler (4D quaternions)
- 1928: Degen (8D octonions)
- 1960: Adams (proved 8D is the absolute limit)
- 2025: mind-git (complete implementation with Coq proofs)

Features:
- Canvas JSON → Parser → AST → Multi-language code generation
- Formal verification ensuring norm preservation: ||a × b|| = ||a|| × ||b||
- CLI tool with 5 binaries (compiler, metadata tools, inference engine)
- 85+ tests, TypeScript definitions, production-ready

Installation:
npm install -g mind-git

Compile example:
mind-git compile spatial-diagram.json
