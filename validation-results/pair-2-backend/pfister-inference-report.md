## 💡 Recommendations


### 1. Direct Integration Viable (Priority: HIGH)

Repositories show 61.0% semantic similarity. Consider direct API integration or code sharing.

**Actions**:
- Identify common interfaces for direct integration
- Extract shared utilities into common library
- Establish unified testing framework


### 2. Unified Testing Framework (Priority: MEDIUM)

Both repositories have substantial test suites. Create unified testing strategy.

**Actions**:
- Merge test utilities and helpers
- Establish common test patterns
- Create integration test suite for composition


### 3. Complementary Architecture (Priority: HIGH)

Repository A focuses on Tests, Repository B on Documentation. Natural composition opportunity.

**Actions**:
- Layer A provides foundational capabilities
- Layer B builds higher-level abstractions
- Clear separation of concerns possible
