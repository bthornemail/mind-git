echo "====================================="

echo "📱 Step 1: Show 3 phones, screens off"
echo "   - Place 3 Android phones on table"
echo "   - All screens black, showing they're just normal phones"
echo "   - No special hardware, just commodity Android devices"

echo ""
echo "💻 Step 2: Install on all phones simultaneously"
echo "   - Terminal: npm install -g emergent-android-intelligence"
echo "   - Show installation completing on all 3 devices"
echo "   - Emphasize: 'No special setup, just npm install'"

echo ""
echo "🚀 Step 3: Start the emergent intelligence network"
echo "   - Phone 1: emergent-android start --role coordinator"
echo "   - Phone 2: emergent-android start --role worker --broker <phone1-ip>"
echo "   - Phone 3: emergent-android start --role hybrid --broker <phone1-ip>"

echo ""
echo "🧠 Step 4: Watch intelligence emerge"
echo "   - ASCII dashboards appear on all phones"
echo "   - Phones start communicating via MQTT"
echo "   - Show real-time message exchange"
echo "   - Highlight: 'No human coordination required'"

echo ""
echo "📋 Step 5: Distributed task demonstration"
echo "   - Command: mind-git-mobile compile test.canvas --distributed"
echo "   - Show task being split across 3 phones"
echo "   - Each phone processes different parts"
echo "   - Results aggregated 3x faster than single phone"
